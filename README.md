# Mindly
Mindly is a gamified mental health and self-care application developed for Android. It is designed as paart of a Master's thesis in Interaction Design at Aalborg University. Mindly acts as a virtual companion that encourages mindfulness, daily structure, and self-reflection.

The app was created to explore how design choices in digital mental health tools influence user engagement, satisfaction, and well-being. Through a one-week field study, Mindly was studied by a group of participants to evaluate four design implications for mental health support.

# Features
- **Task Tracking** - Users log daily tasks and recieve virtual rewards.
  
- **Virtual Companion** - A companion and a customizable room that grows as users progress.

- **Reflection jounal** - Users can create mood-based reflections stored in a calendar view.

- **Gentle Nudging** - Inactivity causes the companion's plant to wilt, encouraging return without punishment.

- **Gamified Interface** - Levels, experience points, and digital furniture rewards to maintain engagement.

# Design Principles
Mindly integrates four core design implications which were identified during our pre-specialization:
1. Flexibility & Adaptability - Users engage on their own terms.
2. Avoidance of Perfectionism Culture - No streaks, no pressure.
3. Support for Time Structuring - Taskand reflection systems to promote balance.
4. Relaxing Digital Spaces - A non-judgmental, emotionally safe user experience.
